# SCMusicPlus
Enhance your SoundCloud experience with the following features:
- Remove Ads
- Remove Promoted Playlists
- Remove Upsell Buttons

# Building
You can build the project any time using GitHub actions. Just run build.yml and you will get both rootful and rootless debs in a zip file.

# Installation
Jailbroken: Add my repo, https://rov3r.github.io/

Sideloaded (TrollStore):
- Download the REGULAR SoundCloud app from the app store (IMPORTANT)
- Sign in to the app
- Delete the app while still signed in
- Download the .ipa (application file) from a source of your choosing
- Use Sideloadly to merge the deb (in Releases) with the ipa
- Once installed, you can enjoy, as you should be logged in already

Sideloaded (Developer Account):
- Until fixed, users will have to link a Google or Facebook account to their SoundCloud. This can be done on the SoundCloud website.
- Download the .ipa (application file) from a source of your choosing
- Use Sideloadly to merge the deb (in Releases) with the ipa
- Install using your preferred sideloading method** (AltStore, Sideloadly, appdb, etc.)
- Once installed, sign in using only via Google or Facebook. Regular email (including gmail) doesn't work for now. This will be addressed in a future update.
